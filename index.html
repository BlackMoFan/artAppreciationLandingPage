                        <p>Painted between 1503 and 1517, Da Vinci’s alluring portrait has been dogged by two questions
                            since the day it was made: Who’s the subject and why is she smiling? A number of theories for the former
                            have been proffered over the years: That she’s the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo
                            del Giocondo (ergo, the work’s alternative title, La Gioconda); that she's Leonardo’s mother, Caterina, conjured
                            from Leonardo's boyhood memories of her; and finally, that it's a self-portrait in drag. As for that famous
                            smile, its enigmatic quality has driven people crazy for centuries. Whatever the reason, Mona Lisa’s look of
                            preternatural calm comports with the idealized landscape behind her, which dissolves into the distance through
                            Leonardo’s use of atmospheric perspective.</p>

                        <p>The Great Wave off Kanagawa (Japanese: 神奈川沖浪裏, Hepburn: Kanagawa-oki Nami Ura, lit.
                            "Under the Wave off Kanagawa"), also known as The Great Wave otherwise known as, The Wave, is a woodblock
                            print by the Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hokusai. It was published sometime between 1829 and 1833 in the late
                            Edo period as the first print in Hokusai's series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. The image depicts an enormous
                            wave threatening three boats off the coast in the Sagami Bay (Kanagawa Prefecture) while Mount Fuji rises in the
                            background. Sometimes assumed to be a tsunami, the wave is more likely to be a large rogue wave.
                            It is Hokusai's most famous work and is often considered the most recognizable work of Japanese art in the world.</p>

                        <p>Johannes Vermeer’s 1665 study of a young woman is startlingly real and startlingly modern,
                            almost as if it were a photograph. This gets into the debate over whether or not Vermeer employed a pre-photographic
                            device called a camera obscura to create the image. Leaving that aside, the sitter is unknown, though it’s
                            been speculated that she might have been Vermeer's maid. He portrays her looking over her shoulder, locking her
                            eyes with the viewer as if attempting to establish an intimate connection across the centuries. Technically
                            speaking, Girl isn’t a portrait, but rather an example of the Dutch genre called a tronie—a headshot meant more
                            as still life of facial features than as an attempt to capture a likeness.</p>

                            from the yin and yang of his personal demons and awe of nature.
